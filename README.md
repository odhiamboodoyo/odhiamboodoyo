        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><p>Hi, I'm <div EMMANUEL="" ODHIAMBO=""></div>, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, user-friendly websites. I have experience in using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills.</p>

        <p>My journey into web development started when I realized how much I enjoy solving problems through code and creating beautiful, functional websites. I have worked on various personal and group projects where I developed front-end interfaces and ensured they were interactive and visually appealing.</p>
        
        <p>Some of my key skills include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong>: Creating structured, semantic content for web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong>: Designing responsive and visually appealing layouts using modern styling techniques.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Adding interactivity and dynamic content to websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control (Git)</strong>: Using Git and GitHub for project collaboration and version management.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Ensuring websites look great on all devices, from mobile to desktop.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Using algorithms and logic to solve programming challenges.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning new skills, contributing to open-source projects, and keeping up with the latest trends in web development.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to check out my projects below or <a href="#contact">contact me</a> for any inquiries or collaborations!</p>
